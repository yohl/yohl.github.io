        <h1 id="center-title" class="font-weight-bold">The Medical Affairs Company Overview</h1>
        <p class="text-muted" id="center-title" style="background:white;">
            *Due to my non-disclosure agreement, I won't be able to share the specifics of my project.<br>
            However, I can talk about the process and the methodology I learned at The Medical Affairs Company.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold" style="margin-top: 60px;">Stuff You Need to Know</h4>
        <p>
            The Medical Affairs Company (TMAC) is a staffing company located in Kennesaw, Georgia for medical science liaisons (MSL) and other medical-related jobs.
            They also provide necessary training for MSLs starting out their careers. They reached out to Betta Innovations (startup I work for) to help in user research for their mobile application. 
            TMAC was working with a local mobile development company, but came to a realization that they didn't quite know how to better serve their MSL users. 
            Before we began our research, we met with the stakeholders from TMAC, and aligned on the goals for this research.
        </p>

        <p>
            They wanted to learn:
            <ul> 
                <li>How can they keep the MSLs engaged within their app.</li>
                <li>What kind of content would be relevant for the users.</li>
                <li>The viability of an app like this in the market.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>



        <div id="project-body">
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Research Planning</h4>
            <p>
                Our process was simple. We got a list of participants from TMAC, and we used Calendly to schedule them for a remote interview session over 2 days.
                Remote sessions were the most convenient for the users because they were constantly traveling for work. We generated a list of questions we wanted to 
                ask the users that would satisfy the goals mentions above. These questions ranged from demographic information, the familiarity of other competitor apps, 
                and how they kept up with current industry news. 
            </p>

        <div id="project-body">
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Interview Process</h4>
            <p>
              I facilitated all of the interviews, and had 1 - 2 note takers. All of the interviews except 1 was conducted through a Zoom call (screenshots below). First, I
              asked permission to record the conversation strictly for documentation purposes (it also helped me to recall certain parts during synthesis). Then, I read
              an overview of TMAC, and asked the questions from the interview scripts to each participants. The note takers followed along with their own copies of 
              the questions and wrote down the corresponding answers. In total we interviewed 13 users over the course of 2 consecutive days.

                You may be wondering why I'd put this train wreck into my portfolio. <b>I'm a firm believer in learning
                    from mistakes.</b> I think making mistakes
                makes you a better learner, because now I know what to look out for and why I need to avoid it. I had 0
                process, 0 methodology, and 0 UX skills;
                I just knew I had to start somehow. Looking back on it, there's a million things I would change about
                this project but the past is past.
                I've definitely refined my process since my time at UCB, and I think the mistakes I made here were a
                catalyst in propelling my career further into UX.
                <b>I wasn't disheartened, rather, hungry to learn more about this mysterious field.</b>
